# HR Employee Attrition Analysis â€“ SQL Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the **IBM HR Analytics Attrition dataset** using **MySQL**.  
The dataset contains employee demographics, job roles, compensation, performance, and attrition status (whether an employee left the company).  

The goal of this project is to uncover patterns and insights that help understand **why employees leave** and which factors contribute most to attrition.

## Key Steps
1. **Database & Table Setup**  
   - Created a structured database in MySQL.  
   - Defined table schema with appropriate datatypes for each column.  
   - Imported the HR attrition dataset into MySQL for analysis.  

2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Ensured column data types matched values (e.g., integers for numeric columns, varchar for categorical data).  
   - Verified data integrity (no missing employee IDs, consistent values).  
   - Standardized categorical values where needed.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Measured **overall attrition rate** (percentage of employees leaving vs. staying).  
   - Analyzed **department-wise attrition** to identify high-turnover areas.  
   - Compared **salary distributions** (average, min, max) between employees who left vs. stayed.  
   - Explored demographic and job-related factors influencing attrition.

## Key Insights
- Employees with **lower average income** showed a higher tendency to leave.  
- Certain departments experienced **significantly higher attrition rates** than others.  
- Although salary ranges overlap, differences in **average pay** highlight potential retention challenges.

## Next Steps
- Extend analysis with **age group, job role, and overtime impact** on attrition.  
- Build **dashboards in Power BI / Tableau** for interactive visualization.  
- Perform **predictive modeling** (in Python/R) to forecast attrition risk.
